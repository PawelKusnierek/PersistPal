        <p>Welcome to PersistPal.com! 🧟<br><br>
        Years ago I created a fansite called <a href="https:/tibiapal.com" target="_blank">'TibiaPal'</a> for the game 'Tibia', also developed by CipSoft (developer of Persist Online).<br>
        TibiaPal has grown massively over the years, at the time of writing receiving approx. 5M visits/year.<br><br>

        This brings us here! I decided to try out Persist Online and fell in love with it - so I decided to create this fansite to also help the community of Persist. <br><br>I plan to continue working on both sites
        (and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/kusnierr" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel!) for the forseeable future so
        if you have any ideas or requests for tools/guides - send me a message in game or via Discord!<br><br>

        Much love and see you in Persist! 💖<br><br>
        <div>Yours, <br>

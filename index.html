    <p>Hello everyone! <br><br>
        A new tool is now available - the <b>Weekly Deliveries</b> reference guide! <br><br>
        This tool includes a complete list of all weekly delivery items with their NPC prices and approximate market values. You can use it to help decide which items are best sold on the market vs. directly to NPCs, saving you time and maximizing your profits!<br><br>
        The tool features filtering by item name and market value categories (Very High, High, Medium, Low) and separate tabs for different delivery NPCs including Rashid, Djinns, Yasir, Telas, Gladys, Esrik/Pompan, Flint, and others.<br><br>
        Check it out at <b><a href="/deliveries" target="_blank">Weekly Deliveries</a></b>!<br><br>
        Hope you find it useful!<br><br>
